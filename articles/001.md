## 001: Starting Over

I'm 29 and totally stuck. I don't get ahead with the things I care about and
have tried to put some effort in during the last couple of years. Those are:

- Literature
- Programming
- Russian

This year, I quit my job and started studying computer science. I'm supposed
to learn a lot about programming (and computers in general) during the next
couple of years. But that won't be enough, or at least I won't learn that
much about the subjects I'm really interested in. I didn't learn a lot at
university during the first term. And I didn't have time to improve in the
areas I really care about--or just squandered it mindlessly on YouTube.

Now I have to change a couple of things.

If I'd just focus on one thing per area at a time, and assign half a year to
every thing, I might actually make some progress again. Those will be little
baby steps, but at least the knowledge can sink in slowly, evenly and deeply.

What are those _things_?

- Literature: _The Iliad_, _The Odyssey_, _Anna Karenina_, _Brothers
Karamazov_, _The Idiot_, _In Search of Lost Time_, _Walden_, etc.
- Programming: Regular Expressions, `bash`, `sed`, `awk`, C, `git`, etc.
- Russian: numerals, verbal aspects, verbs of motion, verb conjugations,
faster touch typing, etc.

What happens if I'd just pick one for, say, January to June 2017? Could I
possibly stick to it?

If I actually could, then I finally would make some progress again.
