## 002: Prelude

I have to pick three projects for the first six months of 2017. I'm not
sure yet what I'm going to pick, but there are some things that attract me
at the moment:

- Literature: _Walden_, by Henry David Thoreau
- Programming: Regular Expressions
- Russian: verb conjugations

Until I'm going to start on those, there's still an entire month. But I can't
just sit and wait and see how my motivation will be faded away by then by doing
nothing. So I'm going to do a little one-month prelude, doing the following:

- Literature: read _Homo Faber_ by Max Frisch
- Programming: get to know the `grep`-command and its options
- Russian: learn the infinitive aspect pairs of the most common 50 Russian
verbs

If I don't manage to do that, I also won't manage to do the "real thing"
next year. So I have to get through with it. Let's get started...
