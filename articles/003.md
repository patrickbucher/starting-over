## 003: This Page

This page is static HTML generated by a shell script called `generate.sh`.

    #!/bin/bash

    PAGE=index.html

    cat header.html > $PAGE
    ls *.md | sort -r | while read md_file; do
        echo '<article>' >> $PAGE
        sed -f smart_quotes.sed < $md_file | markdown | sed '/^\s*$/d' >> $PAGE
        echo '</article>' >> $PAGE
    done
    cat footer.html >> $PAGE

First, a static header file (`header.html`) is written into `index.html`.

Then the script iterates over all articles, which I write in `markdown`
files named from `001.md` to `999.md` (I might have to do some refactoring
during the next three years...). It does so in reverse order, so that the
newest entry is always on top. Every markdown file is first processed by a
`sed` script `smart_quotes.sed`. It replaces straight quotes with nicer quote
characters, two hyphens with a dash and three full stops with an ellipsis.

Every article is converted to HTML using `markdown` and included into the
`index.html` file inside an `<article>` tag. Empty lines are removed with
`sed`.

At the end, the content from `footer.html` is included into `index.html`. And
after the page has been generated, I put it online using `git`.

Other people use so-called "web frameworks" for such tasks.
