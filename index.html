<h4>Saturday, February 11<sup>th</sup> 2017</h4>

<h2 id="015">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#015">015</a>: After a Break</h2>
<p>I didn’t write anything for more than a month. The reason is that I didn’t work
on my personal projects during that time. I had <a href="#012">exams</a> to study for,
which didn’t leave much time (and will power) for other things. The last exam
was on February 1st, and I already had ideas what I wanted to achieve in
February. But instead I relaxed for a couple of days and decided to not set any
goals for February. The next term begins in a bit more than one week, so it’s
good to not have too many side projects with goals and deadlines at the moment.</p>
<p>However, I started reading and working through the book <em>Learn Git in a Month of
Lunches</em>. I thought to write a short summary for every chapter on this page, but
instead I’m putting together <a href="https://github.com/patrickbucher/docs/tree/master/git">one document about
<code>git</code></a> as I’m working
through the book. This page is not the right container for writing long
documentation, or at least not for looking up information, which is the point of
technical documentation. This page is supposed to document general insights
about my learning process.</p>
<p>One thing I did very well as a very young IT apprentice and student was writing
documentation. When I was learning Visual Basic by working through a book, I put
together a Visual Basic tutorial besides. We were also allowed to use
documentation for the final exams in subjects like programming, networking and data
bases. Five friends joined me in the effort to summarize everything we needed to
know for those exams. I coordinated the whole process, and at the end of it, we
not only had a great reference to pass the exams easily, but during the process
I learned so much that I did <em>not even once</em> need to look up information during
the final exams. Learning by summarizing was my approach.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I abandoned that approach some years ago. It’s probably due to my
perfectionism and compulsive orderliness (which got worse in recent years) that
made it more difficult to finish such projects. Instead of succinctly
summarizing the things I learned, I tried to write documentation to be
understood by somebody totally alien to the subject. That’s what the books I’m
reading are for. It’s not the purpose of the summaries I write about them. I was
trying to write for my self that didn’t read the book yet, but I should be
writing for my self that has read and understood the book and just needs a quick
refresh of the knowledge already acquired.</p>
<p>Fine prose and flawless grammar are indispensable in order to explain things,
but they are not the foremost quality feature for a personal reference document.
This is not an excuse for sloppy style, bad grammar and bad spelling! I only
should spend less time trying to cast every bit of information into a nicely
written paragraph, but instead try to reduce prose and optimize the text for
fast lookup. Personal documentation is not for reading, but for looking things
up—and a vehicle for the learning process.</p>
<p>Dropping perfectionism means not trying to write a conclusive summary about a
subject or a book, but to just compile its essential information. I also no
longer will try to create perfectly looking documents, but instead try to be
more productive. So I’ll write my documents in <code>markdown</code> syntax and export them
to the PDF and HTML format using <code>pandoc</code>. Those documents won’t look as good as
carefully hand-crafted LaTeX documents, but still better than most of the
documentation floating around in some software companies that use Microsoft Word
for technical documentation. (I’ve both seen such companies and documents and
miss neither.)</p>
<p>So my next goal is to work through <em>Learn Git in a Month of Lunches</em> and write a
personal summary on <code>git</code> (and not about the book).</p>
<p>PS: I wasn’t totally unproductive in February. I finally made the effort to
change most of my passwords and now use <code>pass</code> as a password manager. It’s not a
great achievement, but proofs the point that it’s possible to abandon bad habits
(and weak passwords).</p>

<h2 id="014">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#014">014</a>: After the Prelude</h2>
<p>More than one month ago, I <a href="#002">decided</a> to focus on three things in December:</p>
<ul>
<li>Literature: read <em>Homo Faber</em> by Max Frisch</li>
<li>Programming: get to know the <code>grep</code>-command and its options</li>
<li>Russian: learn the infinitive aspect pairs of the most common 50 Russian verbs</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve read <em>Homo Faber</em> once. I didn’t care much about the novel until I once
read a couple of pages directly <a href="#012">before falling asleep</a>. After waking up,
I’ve been thinking about those pages intensely. However, I didn’t re-read
anything, which means that the novel didn’t excite me. So I didn’t read deeply,
just superficially. I succeeded formally, but don’t feel very good about it.
Maybe I’ve picked the wrong novel.</p>
<p>I didn’t use <code>grep</code> a lot. But I’ve learned a good deal about regular expressions
and the tools that make use of it, such as <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>. I’ve also created an RSS
feed, which taught me some important lessons about the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag and XML’s
<code>CDATA</code>. I’ve also written articles on <code>grep</code>: about its <a href="#004">matchers</a> and
its <a href="#013">most important options</a>. I’m now feeling comfortable using <code>grep</code>.</p>
<p>I’ve spent little time learning the infinitive aspect pairs of the 50 most
common Russian verbs. I already knew a lot of them before, but nonetheless, I
still cannot write all of them correctly in one sitting when learning them with
flash cards. Creating the flash cards will be important to systematize my
approach of verb learning (by putting them into classes and groups). Working on
my <a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/russisch/50-russkich-tekstov.html">translation
exercise</a>
maybe would have had the better effect on my motivation.</p>
<p>How am I going to continue? In January, I’ll <a href="#011">study for my exams</a>. So I
won’t set any other goals. But I want to try out a new approach for constant
improvements.</p>
<h3>Asking Questions</h3>
<p>Whenever a question or a little problem comes to my mind, I’ll write it down in
a tiny A7 notebook, which I’ll have to carry around with me all the time. If I
don’t know how to translate a word to Russian, how to handle something using a
shell script or have problems remembering details about a novel—I’ll write that
down <em>as a question</em> and won’t look it up on my smartphone. Whenever I have an
idle moment at home, I’ll pick up that little notebook and start to work on one
question. Maybe I’ll also write something on this page about the answer I’ve
found. How could this be helpful?</p>
<p>First, I’ll no longer forget to solve little problems that bug me. It’s very
annoying to stumble upon a problem, being unable to solve it in that moment,
forgetting about it and stumble upon <em>the same problem again</em> afterwards.</p>
<p>Second, It will teach me to <em>ask questions</em> rather than walking around with lots
of <em>issues</em> and <em>problems</em> in my mind. What’s the difference?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Problem</em>: I don’t know how to do <em>X</em> in <code>git</code>. I really don’t know <code>git</code> very
well. I really need to learn <code>git</code>. I don't have time to learn <code>git</code> now,
because I have to sit here at the university and listen to this boring stuff,
I'm already getting a headache...</li>
<li><em>Question</em>: How can I do <em>X</em> in <code>git</code>? It must be possible somehow. Of course
somebody else had a similar problem before. Should I ask a friend or look for
a solution on <em>Stack Overflow</em>? Maybe I should open a thread on my own. Or
maybe better look it up in a book or in the manpages?</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though the term <em>problem</em> isn’t negatively connoted in the language of
engineers and programmers, it always points to some kind of <em>lack</em>; to something
that isn’t good or that is missing. The term <em>question</em>, however, always <em>asks</em>
for an answer or a solution. It implies that there <em>is</em> an answer or solution,
which just has to be found.</p>
<p>So I’ll be trying to find many questions—and answers to them.</p>

<h2 id="013">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#013">013</a>: Some <code>grep</code> Options</h2>
<p>In order to demonstrate some <code>grep</code> options, I’ll be working with this test
file <code>test.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>This file is a test file.
I use it to work with grep.
It has three lines and nothing else.
</code></pre>
<p>To match all the letters <em>i</em>, <code>grep</code> can be invoked like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep 'i' test.txt
This file is a test file.
I use it to work with grep.
It has three lines and nothing else.
</code></pre>
<p>The whole file <code>test.txt</code> will be printed as a result, because every line
contains the small letter <em>i</em>, and grep outputs the whole line of a match by
default.</p>
<p>Using the <code>-o</code> option (<code>--only-matching</code>), only the matching parts are printed,
which are a couple of <em>i</em>s:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -o 'i' test.txt
i
i
i
i
i
i
i
i
</code></pre>
<p>Adding the <code>-n</code> option (<code>--line-number</code>) also outputs the line number of
the matched <em>i</em>s:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -no 'i' test.txt
1:i
1:i
1:i
1:i
2:i
2:i
3:i
3:i
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-c</code> option (<code>--count</code>) counts the number of matches and outputs a sum
instead of the matches.</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -c 'i' test.txt
3
</code></pre>
<p>Using the <code>-c</code> option together with <code>-n</code> or <code>-o</code> is pointless.</p>
<p>The capital letter <em>T</em> only matches for one of the three lines:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep 'T' test.txt
This file is a test file.
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-i</code> option (<code>--ignore-case</code>), however, ignores case distinctions and hence
prints all three lines, which all contain the letter <em>t</em>:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -i 'T' test.txt
This file is a test file.
I use it to work with grep.
It has three lines and nothing else.
</code></pre>
<p>The effect can also be demonstrated when using <code>-i</code> and <code>-c</code> in combination:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -c 'T' test.txt
1
$ grep -ic 'T' test.txt
3
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-v</code> option (<code>--invert-match</code>) inverts the sense of matching. Grepping for
<em>T</em> in <code>test.txt</code> again with that option shows the two other lines that <em>don’t</em>
contain a <em>T</em>:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -v 'T' test.txt
I use it to work with grep.
It has three lines and nothing else.
</code></pre>
<p>This option can also be combined with <code>-c</code>, which gives the number of lines
<em>not</em> containing a capital letter <em>T</em>:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -cv 'T' test.txt
2
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-r</code> option (<code>--recursive</code>) makes <code>grep</code> suitable not just for files
(or keyboard input),
but for entire directories, which are processed recursively. If I wanted
to know
how often I already mentioned the novel <em>Homo Faber</em> in my diary, I could
simply
type:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -cr 'Homo Faber' articles/
articles/006.md:0
articles/012.md:3
articles/013.md:2
articles/008.md:0
articles/010.md:2
articles/011.md:1
articles/007.md:0
articles/009.md:2
articles/001.md:0
articles/002.md:1
articles/005.md:0
articles/004.md:0
articles/.013.md.swp:2
articles/003.md:0
</code></pre>
<p>This tells me how often I mentioned <em>Homo Faber</em> <em>by file</em>. If I’m
interested in
a grand total instead, I’d better use <code>grep</code> in combination with <code>cat</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat articles/* | grep -c 'Homo Faber'
11
</code></pre>
<p>The attentive reader might already have noticed that the two matches from the
<code>vim</code> swap file <code>.013.md.swp</code> are not counted using the second command. It will
be an interesting exercise for me to find out why this is the case.</p>
<p>As we have seen, <code>grep</code> only prints the file name when it is working on more
than one file at a time. This, however, is the default behaviour, it could be
overridden using the <code>-h</code> option (<code>--no-filename</code>) or the <code>-H</code> option
(<code>--with-filename</code>), respectively:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -H 'i' test.txt
test.txt:This file is a test file.
test.txt:I use it to work with grep.
test.txt:It has three lines and nothing else.
$ grep -hcr 'Homo Faber' articles/
0
3
5
0
2
1
0
2
0
1
0
0
5
0
</code></pre>
<p>I still have to find a use-case for those two options. Omitting the file names
might come in handy in the latter example when trying to sum up a grand
total of
occurrences.</p>
<p>The <code>-w</code> option (<code>--word-regexp</code>) only matches the given pattern when it
occurs as an entire word. That saves the user from creating complicated
expressions for the same purpose (line breaks, tabs spaces, full stops etc. can
all be used as a word boundary and must be considered accordingly).</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -w 'I' test.txt
I use it to work with grep.
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the line containing the word “It” wasn’t matched, because the
pattern “I” isn’t matched <em>as an entire word</em> there.</p>
<p>The <code>-x</code> option (<code>--line-regexp</code>) only matches the given pattern for entire
lines, thus saving the user from surrounding the pattern manually with <code>^</code>
(beginning of a line) and <code>$</code> (ending of a line). It makes the regular
expression a bit smaller, doesn’t really solve a problem in my opinion.</p>
<pre><code>$ grep  '^This file is a test file.$'
This file is a test file.
$ grep -x 'This file is a test file.'
This file is a test file.
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-e</code> option (<code>--regexp</code>) can be used when matching multiple patterns, with
one pattern after every <code>-e</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -e 'file' -e 'work' test.txt
This file is a test file.
I use it to work with grep.
</code></pre>
<p>The patterns are matched using <em>or</em> logic: every line matches one or more
patterns is displayed. This could also be written like this, using extended
regular expressions (don’t mix up <code>-e</code> and <code>-E</code>):</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -E '(file|work)' test.txt
This file is a test file.
I use it to work with grep.
</code></pre>
<p>An <em>and</em> logic can be implemented when piping multiple <code>grep</code> calls, applying
them as a filter. Here’s <code>test2.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>a b
b c
c a
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s first match all lines containing the letter <em>a</em>, then all lines
containing
the letter <em>b</em>. Afterwards, let’s match only the lines that <em>both</em> contain the
latter <em>a</em> and the letter <em>b</em>:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep 'a' test2.txt
a b
c a
$ grep 'c' test2.txt
b c
c a
$ grep 'a' test2.txt | grep 'c'
c a
</code></pre>
<p>When using expressions that are tedious to type afresh every time, the <code>-f</code>
option (<code>--file</code>) option might come in handy. All the patterns to be matched
(in
the aforementioned <em>or</em> logic) can be put inside a file (<code>patterns.txt</code>) and
then be re-used:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat &gt; patterns.txt
file
work
$ grep -f patterns.txt test.txt
This file is a test file.
I use it to work with grep.
</code></pre>
<p>This has exactly the same effect as:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -e 'file' -e 'work' test.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Those are all the <code>grep</code> options <a href="#009">I wanted to get to know</a> in December. I
am not an expert with <code>grep</code> yet, but now I feel fairly comfortable when using
it. This is a solid foundation for working more intensively with regular
expressions.</p>

<h2 id="012">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#012">012</a>: The Last Thing Before Sleep</h2>
<p>Two nights ago, something strange happened.</p>
<p>I was reading <em>Homo Faber</em> from Max Frisch. <em>Walter Faber</em>, the hero of that
short novel, met <em>Elisabeth</em> on a ship from New York to France. Hi didn’t know
that she was his daughter, he didn’t even know that he had a daughter, because
he thought <em>Hanna</em>, his former girlfriend, had an abortion.</p>
<p>Walter Faber and Elisabeth met again in Paris and then travelled together to
Rome. He wanted to marry her, but she neither denied nor accepted. They
continued their journey to Athens, where Hanna, Elisabeth’s mother, lives.</p>
<p>When Walter was swimming and Elisabeth sleeping at the beach, a snake bit her.
She also fell down and got severely hurt when landing, but Walter didn’t really
notice, because the snake bite seemed more important at that time.</p>
<p>He managed to bring her to a hospital in Athens somehow, where he met
again with
Hanna. Elisabeth died on the next day, but not from the snake bite, but
from her
neck injury.</p>
<p>I closed the book and quickly fell to sleep. After a couple of hours, I woke up
and suddenly some thoughts about <em>Homo Faber</em> came to my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole book seems to be about the antagonism between heart and mind;
between feelings and thoughts. Walter Faber is the engineer, the thinker;
Hanna--and Ivy and Elisabeth--are rather artists and feelers. Walter was
taking care of the snake bite close to Elisabeth's heart, but didn't
notice her
injury next to hear brain. The snake bite wasn't dangerous at all. Something
(it might be love) made Walter act in irrational ways, which marks his
transition from thinking to feeling, at least in this situation. He no longer
lives up to his higly rational standards.</li>
<li>Elisabeth had three little wounds from the snake bite. Not two, not four.
Snakes have two long poisonous teeth on the upper jaw and two shorter
counterparts on the lower jaw. Why three wounds? It's hardly a co-incidence,
I
think it stands as a symbol for the deadly reunion of the three, which
was not
supposed to happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t care that much for <em>Homo Faber</em> up to then. But after that episode, I
was thinking about the novel very intensively. Hadn’t I read that important
part
of the book directly before falling asleep, I might not have really cared about
it either.</p>
<p>This should teach me a lesson: It’s not only important to work intensely and
focused on something, it is just as important to give the brain some rest
afterwards. And sleeping is by far the best way of resting for the brain.
Resting doesn’t mean doing nothing, it means: don’t occupy the brain with
external stimuli, but let it work on the information it already has.</p>
<p>I already <em>knew</em> that, of course, but now I really <em>felt</em> it.</p>

<h4>Thursday, December 22<sup>nd</sup> 2016</h4>

<h2 id="011">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#011">011</a>: Being Realistic</h2>
<p>The title of the aforementioned book <em>Learn git in a Month of Lunches</em> made me
think. Half a year might not be the proper duration for every project,
one month
might be enough for some.</p>
<p>So I thought to assign January 2017 to that book. But there’s a problem: In
January I have my term exams, and I’ll have to learn for those, which
will leave
little time for own projects. Having one relatively unproductive month is not
that much of a problem when you have six of them for one project.  It is,
however, when you only have one.</p>
<p>I’m thinking of focusing entirely on the term exams in January. The last
exam will be exactly on January 31st. However, after the math exam, there won’t
be that much to prepare. And I’m not willing to invest all of my time in
learning for the exams, because there are some topics I’m not remotely
interested in. Here I’m going to be pragmatic: I’ll learn what I need to pass
the exams safely, but I don’t strive for excellency.</p>
<p>Instead of working on certain additional projects in January, I just could work
on my habits, so that I’ll be in a better mental shape in February for upcoming
projects. I could try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>sleep for eight or more hours every night by trying to get to bed at 10
o'clock p.m.</li>
<li>get up early (if I manage to go to sleep early)</li>
<li>walk for at least one hour a day (I’m already doing on the days I’m going
to university, which I don't have to do in January.)</li>
<li>not buying things I don’t need (more books, new electronic devices,
superfluous groceries)</li>
</ul>
<p>This will leave me more relaxed and, hopefully, I’ll be able to learn in a more
focused way.</p>
<p>PS: I’ve been reading another third of <em>Homo Faber</em>, but didn’t work with
<code>grep</code>
and my Russian flash cards.</p>

<h4>Thursday, December 15<sup>th</sup> 2016</h4>

<h2 id="010">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#010">010</a>: For How Long?</h2>
<p>In my <a href="#001">initial post</a>, I had the idea to assign half a year to the things
I want to do in each of the three areas I care about the most (literature,
programming and Russian). Sticking to one thing already proved to be hard
for one month—even for the first two weeks I tried to stick to it so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>Literature: I’ve been reading parts of <em>Homo Faber</em> and nothing else.</li>
<li>Programming: I got to learn the <code>grep</code> command with its modes and some of
its flags. But I worked much more with <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>, which of course also
helped me to understand regular expressions and hence the usage of <code>grep</code>
better. But I didn’t invest much time in playing around with <code>grep</code>.</li>
<li>Russian: I’ve been working with flash cards. I didn’t put in a lot of effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>In literature and Russian, I was focused insofar that I didn’t tackle
other books or topics. This is probably due to the fact that I have a lot
of other things going on for my studies at the moment. In programming,
I wasn’t really focused.</p>
<p>I thought to tackle regular expressions from January to June 2017. Now I’m
thinking about Go, <code>git</code> and Java 8 again. Not touching any of those for
six months will be quite hard.</p>
<p>After my first month, the <a href="#002">prelude</a>, I should consider the time frame
for the next block. Doubling the length might be a good idea. Or adding one
month at a time. Or maybe I should re-consider the time frame for the next
block during the preceding block. I might even have to put one or two buffer
weeks in between to review the last and plan the next block.</p>
<p>I recently ordered the book <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/learn-git-in-a-month-of-lunches">Learn git in a Month of
Lunches</a>.
Working through—not just reading—one chapter should take one hour, the
author says. Since I already have some experience with <code>git</code>, it might take
even less time, at least at the beginning.</p>
<p>I think it’s OK to consider different time frames for my upcoming
projects. It’s only important to stick to those plans afterwards. Half a year
to read one book might be too long for some books (say, <em>Homo Faber</em>), and
too short for others (say, Gibbon’s <em>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em>).</p>
<p>In December, I’ll be both thinking about <em>what</em> projects I’m going to tackle
first in 2017, but also <em>how much time</em> I’m going to assign to those.</p>

<h4>Sunday, December 11<sup>th</sup> 2016</h4>

<h2 id="009">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#009">009</a>: In the Midst of the Prelude</h2>
<p>As I’ve already written, the last month of 2016 is supposed to be some kind
of a <a href="#002">prelude</a> for the new way I’m going to work on my projects. How
is it going so far?</p>
<h3>Literature: <em>Homo Faber</em> by Max Frisch</h3>
<p>I haven’t been reading that much for the last two weeks. I’m now on page 64
(of 202), so I need to read a bit more.</p>
<p><em>Homo Faber</em> is subtitled as a report. <em>Walter Faber</em>, who works as
an Engineer, tells the story of his life. Travelling in the Americas,
many unexpected things happen to him. He gets seated next to <em>Herbert</em>,
the brother of his old friend <em>Joachim</em>, in an airplane. On their flight to
Mexico, an engine breaks down and they need to do an emergency landing in
the desert of Mexico.</p>
<p>During their stay in the desert, Walter and Joachim get to know each other.
Herbert wants to travel to his brother Joachim, who owns and operates a tobacco
plantation in Guatemala. Walter decides to join Herbert. After a long journey,
they discover that Joachim had hung himself.</p>
<p>Walter Faber also reports on the relationship he had to Hanna, a half-jew,
in the early 1930s. She got pregnant, but didn’t want to marry him. He
thought that she will have an abortion.</p>
<p>Now Walter Faber is in a relationship with <em>Ivy</em>, but wants to give up their
common apartment in New York.</p>
<p>(I really had trouble writing about the first 64 pages, and I also had to
look up some of the details. This is exactly how I should <em>not</em> be reading. If
I’d read <em>well</em> so far, I’d be remembering everything know.)</p>
<h3>Programming: the <code>grep</code> Command</h3>
<p>Honestly, I didn’t work with <code>grep</code> that much as I wanted to. I’m now aware
about its <a href="#004">different matchers</a> and the <code>-l</code> flag. However, I discovered
that knowing those modes is also helpful for other tools, such as <code>sed</code>,
which uses basic regular expressions by default, but is also capable of
using extended regular expressions when invoked with the <code>-r</code> flag.</p>
<p>Regular expressions have to be learned as a fundamental concept (of UNIX),
not just as some syntax used in many (UNIX) utilities. This discovery is
more valuable than knowing every arcane flag of the <code>grep</code> command.</p>
<p>However, there are some more flags I really need to know in order to work
effectively and efficiently with <code>grep</code>, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-c</code> to count matches,</li>
<li><code>-e</code> to work with multiple patterns,</li>
<li><code>-f</code> to work with entire files containing patterns,</li>
<li><code>-h</code> and <code>-H</code> to add or omit the filename for each match,</li>
<li><code>-i</code> for case-<em>in</em>sensitive matching,</li>
<li><code>-n</code> to prefix matching lines with a number,</li>

<li><code>-v</code> to invert the sense of matching,</li>
<li><code>-w</code> and <code>-x</code> to only match whole words or lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the other flags listed by the <code>grep</code> man page, I don’t see any use at
the moment, so I’m going to leave those away. For the rest of this month,
I’ll get to know the ones listed above.</p>
<h3>Russian: Aspect Pairs of the 50 Most Common Russian Verbs</h3>
<p>I’ve found a <a href="http://masterrussian.com/vocabulary/common_verbs.htm">frequency
list</a> of the most common
Russian verbs. I’ve written down the first 50 of them to flash cards in their
aspect pairs. Then I’ve written their German translation (or translations)
on the other side.</p>
<p>When learning with those flash cards, I was able to translate around two
thirds of them the first time, so I can focus on the other third for the next
two weeks. At the end of the month, I can put the stack of those fifty cards
back together and learn them all at once, which should not take too much time.</p>
<p>I’m going to use those cards also next year when I’m learning verb conjugations
in a more systematic manner. I hope that using those 50 verbs, all categories
and groups are already covered.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I’ve already achieved a lot, and it didn’t seem to be hard work at any
time. The most important thing is that I’ve been working on this page a
lot. I have already written productive code in <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>, which I
didn’t do anytime before.</p>
<p>On the down side, I really have to read in a more focused manner. Or maybe
I have to read everything twice in order to make it stick.</p>

<h2 id="008">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#008">008</a>: RSS Feed</h2>
<p>As my friend <a href="http://marmaro.de">meillo</a> suggested, I introduced an <a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/feed.rss">RSS
feed</a>. I wasn’t
very motivated to do that in the first place, because RSS is XML, after
all. But, nonetheless, I did the first step and implemented <a href="#005">links to
individual articles</a> a couple of days ago, so that I could use them
in the feed. First, I thought that Python (and some XML or RSS library)
rather than <code>awk</code> would be the proper tool for the task. But then I thought
how it could be done using <code>awk</code>, and I did so in combination with <code>bash</code>.</p>
<p>First, let’s have look at the big picture, the <code>rss.sh</code> script, that is:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
rm -f feed.rss
awk -F '=' -f awk/rss-header.awk meta.txt &gt; feed.rss
ls articles/*.md | sort -r | while read md_file; do
    awk -f awk/rss-body.awk $md_file &gt;&gt; feed.rss
done
echo -e "&lt;/channel&gt;\n&lt;/rss&gt;" &gt;&gt; feed.rss
</code></pre>
<p>This script creates (but first deletes) a file called <code>feed.rss</code>, the actual
RSS feed. It does so in three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>It creates the header based on the file <code>meta.txt</code>, then</li>
<li>it iterates over all articles and creates an item for each of them,</li>
<li>and it adds a footer using the <code>echo</code> command.</li>
</ol>
<p>The file <code>meta.txt</code> contains metadata and looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>title=Starting Over
url=https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/
description=Let’s make some progress again.
language=en
author=Patrick Bucher, patrick.bucher87@gmail.com
</code></pre>
<p>These are simple key-value pairs, separated by an equals sign. The
<code>rss-header.awk</code> script is called, setting the <code>-F</code> parameter to the equals
sign, so that the key goes into variable <code>$1</code> and the value into variable
<code>$2</code>. Here’s the full script <code>rss-header.awk</code>:</p>
<pre><code>BEGIN {
    print "&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;"
    print "&lt;rss version=\"2.0\"
    xmlns:atom=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"&gt;"
    print "&lt;channel&gt;"
    printf "&lt;atom:link
    href=\"https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/feed.rss\" "
    print "rel=\"self\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" /&gt;"
}
/^title=/ {
    print "&lt;title&gt;" $2 "&lt;/title&gt;"
}
/^url=/ {
    print "&lt;link&gt;" $2 "&lt;/link&gt;"
}
/^description=/ {
    print "&lt;description&gt;" $2 "&lt;/description&gt;"
}
/^language=/ {
    print "&lt;language&gt;" $2 "&lt;/language&gt;"
}
/^author=/ {
    print "&lt;copyright&gt;" $2 "&lt;/copyright&gt;"
}
END {
    print "&lt;pubDate&gt;" strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z") "&lt;/pubDate&gt;"
}
</code></pre>
<p>At the beginning, the RSS header (with an optional but recommended
atom link) is created. Then, for every match of a meta variable (title,
url, description, language and author) a header tag is created (title,
link, description, language and copyright). Furthermore, the current
date and time is added as the pubDate tag using <a href="http://www.feedvalidator.org/docs/error/InvalidRFC2822Date.html">RFC-822 date-time
format</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>rss-body.awk</code> script is invoked once for every article. It generates one
<code>&lt;item&gt;</code> for every article, which is opened in <code>BEGIN</code> and closed in <code>END</code>:</p>
<pre><code>BEGIN {
    print "&lt;item&gt;"
}
END {
    print "&lt;/item&gt;"
}
</code></pre>
<p>The main title is matched with two leading number signs (<code>##</code>), which are cut
off for the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag using the <code>gensub()</code> function. For both <code>&lt;url&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;guid&gt;</code> the URL to the individual article is used. The article number
has to be extracted for that purpose, which is done using the <code>substr()</code>
function. Here’s the whole function:</p>
<pre><code>/^## / {
    $0 = gensub(/^## (.+)/, "\\1", "1");
    print "&lt;title&gt;" $0 "&lt;/title&gt;"
    $1 = substr($1, 0, 3); # 001: -&gt; 001
    url = "https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#" $1
    print "&lt;link&gt;" url "&lt;/link&gt;"
    print "&lt;guid&gt;" url "&lt;/guid&gt;"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the <code>&lt;pubDate&gt;</code> field in the header, the <code>&lt;pubDate&gt;</code> field for
individual also requires the RFC-822 format. Unfortunately, I write the
publication dates like this: “Wednesday, December 7th 2016”. So this date
string needs to be converted accordingly. Since I don’t indicate a time, I
have to make it up and just picked midnight, so that the channel’s <code>pubDate</code>
will always be later than every individual article’s <code>pubDate</code>.</p>
<p>Weekday and month are easy to handle, I just have to cut off the first three
characters with <code>substr()</code>. The month’s day can easily be matched with one
or more digits, followed by two letters using <code>gensub()</code>. As mentioned,
the time is made up using CET, which is GMT +1 hour. Here’s the full function:</p>
<pre><code>/^#### / {
    weekday = $2
    month = $3
    monthday = $4
    year = $5
    printf "&lt;pubDate&gt;"
    printf substr(weekday, 0, 3) ", " # Monday, -&gt; Mon,
    printf gensub(/([[:digit:]]+)[[:alpha:]]{2}/, "\\1", "1", monthday)
    " " # 4th -&gt; 4
    printf substr(month, 0, 3) " " # January -&gt; Jan
    printf year " "
    printf "00:00:00 +0100"
    print "&lt;/pubDate&gt;"
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> has to be wrapped in a <code>CDATA</code> section. Since I don’t
want to put the whole article inside it, but just the first paragraph, I call
<code>exit</code> to stop processing matching lines—those starting with one or many
alphanumeric characters:</p>
<pre><code>/^[[:alpha:]]+/ {
    print "&lt;description&gt;&lt;![CDATA[" $0 " …]]&gt;&lt;/description&gt;"
    exit
}
</code></pre>
<p>Of course I also have to call the <code>rss.sh</code> script from <code>generate.sh</code>, so
that the Website and the RSS feed always represent the same content.</p>

<h2 id="007">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#007">007</a>: Tiny little improvements</h2>
<p>Today, I did a couple of tiny little improvements. The <code>awk</code> script I’ve
written yesterday had some minor problems. I did use <code>sub</code> rather than <code>gsub</code>
to perform the replacements of three full stops with an ellipsis and two
hyphens with an n-dash. So only the first occurrence per line was replaced.</p>
<p>I also switched from n-dashes to m-dashes. The latter must not be surrounded
by spaces. I decided to replace the three existing occurrences manually. I
used this command to find all the occurrences:</p>
<pre><code>grep -l ' -- ' articles/*.md
</code></pre>
<p>The parameter <code>-l</code> displays the files for which the pattern matches, rather
than the matching lines.</p>
<p>I also discovered a minor glitch in the version I used before. In article
<a href="#004">004: grep Matchers</a>, I’ve written down some long form parameters,
such as <code>--basic-regexp</code> and <code>--extended-regexp</code>. Those two hyphens had been
replaced with a dash, which clearly doesn’t work in the shell. So I had to
extend my <code>typography.awk</code> script even further, so that it only replaces
two hyphens between alphanumeric characters (now with an <em>m</em>-dash). Here’s
how the modified lines look like now:</p>
<pre><code>!/^([[:space:]]+|####)/ {
    # quote replacements omitted
    gsub(/\.\.\./, "…");
    $0 = gensub(/([[:alnum:]]+)--([[:alnum:]]+)/, "\\1—\\2", "g");
    print;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also discovered that the <code>sed</code> supports extended regular expressions by
invoking it with the option <code>-r</code>. Doing so makes the <code>add_link.sed</code> script
a bit more readable, because parentheses to capture groups and quantifiers
no longer need to be escaped. Here’s the new version:</p>
<pre><code>s/&lt;h2&gt;([[:digit:]]+):/\
&lt;h2 id="\1"&gt;\
&lt;a href="https:\/\/patrickbucher.github.io\
\/starting-over\/index.html#\1"&gt;\1&lt;\/a&gt;:/
</code></pre>
<p>These are tiny little improvements, after all, but as I said: getting ahead
with tiny little baby steps is still better than being totally stuck.</p>

<h4>Monday, December 5<sup>th</sup> 2016</h4>

<h2 id="006">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#006">006</a>: Introducing awk</h2>
<p>The <code>sed</code> script <code>smart_quotes.sed</code> had a major flaw. It didn’t distinguish
between text lines and code lines. So quotes and double quotes have also
been replaced inside code blocks, which messed up their semantics. I didn’t
manage to fix the problem using <code>sed</code>, so I did what most people would do
in that situation: use <code>awk</code> instead.</p>
<p><code>markdown</code> has an easy syntax for code blocks: just indent the line. I do
so by four spaces. So the <code>awk</code> script could just ignore indented lines and
print them as they are:</p>
<pre><code>/^[[:space:]]+/ {
    print;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A line starting with one or more spaces is simply printed out as it is. The
other lines can be captured as follows:</p>
<pre><code>!/^[[:space:]]+/ {
    # do typographical replacements
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is simply the same pattern, but inverted by using an exclamation
mark. The following replacements must be done: First, straight double and
single quotes must be replaced with their typographically correct counterparts:</p>
<pre><code>sub(/^"/, "“");
$0 = gensub(/([[:space:]]+)"/, "\\1“", "g");
gsub(/"/, "”");
</code></pre>
<p>The first line replaces a double quote right after the beginning of the line
with an opening double quote using the <code>sub()</code> function. The second line
replaces all double quotes that come after one or many space characters,
also with an opening quote. Those space characters are captured in a group
and retained in the output by using the back reference <code>\\1</code>. The global flag
<code>g</code> is also passed to make sure that not only one, but all occurrences are
replaced. I had to use the <code>gensub()</code> function here, which supports back
references. It doesn’t modify the line variable <code>$0</code>, but returns the result
of the replacement for manual assignment. All the remaining double quotes
must be replaced by closing double quotes. For this purpose, the <code>gsub()</code>
function is called, which works like <code>sub()</code> but globally, i.e. handles many
occurrences. (This would be pointless for the first substitution, because
it only replaces the double quote right after the beginning of the line,
and a line begins only once.)</p>
<p>The same is done for single quotes:</p>
<pre><code>sub(/^'/, "‘");
$0 = gensub(/([[:space:]]+)'/, "\\1‘", "g");
gsub(/'/, "’");
</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, three full stops have to be replaced with an ellipsis, and two
hyphens with an n-dash. (I have to consider using m-dashes without surrounding
spaces instead, this page is written in English, after all…) At the end of
the function, the line is printed using the <code>print</code> function. If no parameter
is passed, it prints the content of the variable <code>$0</code>, which contains the
whole line.</p>
<pre><code>sub(/\.\.\./, "…");
sub(/--/, "‒");
print;
</code></pre>
<p>As I’ve written before, the ordinal numbers in the dates should be displayed
properly; i.e. “December 5<sup>th</sup>” (using superscript) rather than
“December 5th”. The following <code>awk</code> function handles this:</p>
<pre><code>/^####/ {
    $0 = gensub(/([[:digit:]]{1,2})([[:alpha:]]{2})/, "\\1&lt;sup&gt;\\2&lt;/sup&gt;",
    "1");
    print;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I use <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> headlines for the date indications, which are indicated as
<code>####</code> in <code>markdown</code>. The part to be put inside of <code>&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</code> only
consists of the two letters following a one- or two-digit number, it is
captured in the second group and printed using the second back references
(<code>\\2</code>). Since only one occurrence has to be replaced—there <em>is</em> only one
possible occurrence—the quantity <code>1</code> rather than the flag <code>g</code> has been used.</p>
<p>Now we run into the problem that the line containing the date indication
is processed twice: Firstly, by the function matching for pound characters;
and, secondly, by the function matching anything <em>not</em> starting with white
space. So we have to exclude the date indications from the other function:</p>
<pre><code>!/^([[:space:]]+|####)/ {
    # typographical replacements
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now that function matches any line <em>not</em> starting with one or many spaces
or four pound characters.</p>
<p>Here’s the <code>typography.awk</code> script in full:</p>
<pre><code>/^[[:space:]]+/ {
    print;
}
!/^([[:space:]]+|####)/ {
    sub(/^"/, "“");
    $0 = gensub(/([[:space:]]+)"/, "\\1“", "g");
    gsub(/"/, "”");
    sub(/^'/, "‘");
    $0 = gensub(/([[:space:]]+)'/, "\\1‘", "g");
    gsub(/'/, "’");
    sub(/\.\.\./, "…");
    sub(/--/, "‒");
    print;
}
/^####/ {
    $0 = gensub(/([[:digit:]]{1,2})([[:alpha:]]{2})/, "\\1&lt;sup&gt;\\2&lt;/sup&gt;",
    "1");
    print;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>generate.sh</code> script also needed some modifications: The typographic
operations are now performed <em>before</em> <code>markdown</code> converted the article to HTML:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
PAGE=index.html
cat html/header.html &gt; $PAGE
ls articles/*.md | sort -r | while read md_file; do
    echo '&lt;article&gt;' &gt;&gt; $PAGE
    awk -f 'awk/typography.awk' $md_file | markdown \
        | sed '/^\s*$/d' | sed -f 'sed/add_link.sed' &gt;&gt; $PAGE
    echo '&lt;/article&gt;' &gt;&gt; $PAGE
done
cat html/footer.html &gt;&gt; $PAGE
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe the <code>add_link.sed</code> script would be easier in <code>awk</code>, too? At least I’ll
be coding again when trying!</p>

<h2 id="005">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#005">005</a>: Automatically Link to Individual Articles</h2>
<p>In order to link to a specific article on this page, rather than just to
this page as a whole, I implemented a <code>sed</code> script. It is executed after the
transformation from <code>markdown</code> to HTML has taken place. Here’s how the script
<code>add_link.sed</code> looks like:</p>
<pre><code>s/&lt;h2&gt;\([[:digit:]]\+\):/\
&lt;h2 id="\1"&gt;\
&lt;a href="https:\/\/patrickbucher.github.io\
\/starting-over\/index.html#\1"&gt;\1&lt;\/a&gt;:/
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s break it apart. The script consists of a single substitute command,
which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>s/regex/replacement/flags
</code></pre>
<p>There are four parts divided by slashes. The initial <code>s</code> stands for
“substitute”. The first expression <code>regex</code> is a regular expression to be
searched for in the input. The second expression <code>replacement</code> defines the
value the matched regular expression is to be replaced with. At the end,
<code>flags</code> could be provided.</p>
<p>It’s not that easy to distinguish those parts in the command above, because
it contains additional (escaped) slashes, and the parts heavily vary in
size. (The command also has been spread over four lines; a line does not
correspond to the parts mentioned, however.) Here’s the regular expression:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;\([[:digit:]]\+\):
</code></pre>
<p>This expression looks rather cryptic, but its meaning becomes clear, when
one looks at a sample input line to be matched:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;004: grep Matchers&lt;/h2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We have a level two headline (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>) consisting of a number and a textual
description, separated by a colon and a space. Only the leading number, rather
than the whole title, should be converted to a hyperlink. Unsurprisingly,
the expression starts by matching <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>. <code>[[:digit:]]</code> matches <em>one</em>
digit; with the <code>+</code> quantifier added, it matches <em>one or many</em> digits. In
order to be interpreted as a meta character, rather than literally, the <code>+</code>
modifier needs to be escaped by a leading backslash. Matching <em>one or many</em>
digits thus becomes: <code>[[:digit:]]\+</code>.</p>
<p>The matched digits will be used for three purposes in the output:</p>
<ol>
<li>As an anchor to identify the title,</li>
<li>as a part of the hyperlink</li>
<li>and as the text shown for the hyperlink.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the matched digits are captured inside a <em>group</em> using parentheses:
<code>([[:digit:]]\+)</code>. Those parentheses must be interpreted as meta characters,
rather than literally, so they need to be escaped, too: <code>\([[:digit:]]\+\)</code>.</p>
<p>Before dissecting the replacement expression, let’s take a look at the
intended output:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h2 id="004"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/index.html#004"&gt;
004&lt;/a&gt;: grep Matchers&lt;/h2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>(The title had to be spread over four lines because it would not fit
horizontally on this page.) Most of the output is also contained in the
<code>sed</code> replacement expressions. The article number, which is used three times
as described above, is included with a back reference to the first group
matched <code>\1</code> (there’s only one matched group in this example). Furthermore,
line breaks and slashes (such as in <code>http://</code> and <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code>) had to be escaped
using backslashes (resulting in <code>http:\/\/</code> and <code>&lt;\/a&gt;</code>), leading to this
somewhat convoluted replacement expression:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h2 id="\1"&gt;\
&lt;a href="https:\/\/patrickbucher.github.io\
\/starting-over\/index.html#\1"&gt;\1&lt;\/a&gt;:
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>sed</code> command is ended by a slash, no flags have been used.</p>
<p>PS: For the date indications on top of every article, I should consider
using superscript for the ordinal numbers, such as <em>December 4<sup>th</sup></em>
rather than <em>December 4th</em>. A lot of small scripting tasks come along,
when one starts writing a fully automated diary or blog, which is exactly
the purpose of <em>Starting Over</em>.</p>

<h4>Friday, December 2<sup>nd</sup> 2016</h4>

<h2 id="004">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#004">004</a>: grep Matchers</h2>
<p>The GNU version of <code>grep</code> offers four different matchers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fixed strings (<code>grep -F, --fixed-strings</code>): There are no meta characters
in this mode, every character is interpreted literally.</li>
<li>Basic regular expressions (BRE, <code>grep -G, --basic-regexp</code>): This
is the default mode of <code>grep</code>: Meta characters need to be escaped using
backslashes. <code>a{1,2}</code> would be interpreted literally as the string <code>a{1,2}</code>,
while <code>a\{1,2\}</code> stands for <em>one or two small letters ‘a’</em>.</li>
<li>Extended regular expressions (ERE, <code>grep -E, --extended-regexp</code>): This is
the default mode of <code>egrep</code>: Meta characters, such as those in quantifiers,
don’t need to be escaped. There are also shortcuts for some commonly used
quantifiers <code>?</code> (zero or one, instead of <code>{0,1}</code>), <code>*</code> (zero, one or many;
instead of <code>{0,}</code>) and <code>+</code> (one or more; instead of <code>{1,}</code>).</li>
<li>Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE, <code>grep -P, --perl-regexp</code>):
This one offers the most powerful features, but many features are
experimental. Therefore I won’t be using them ‒ unless I program in Perl.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m mostly interested in extended regular expressions, because they are
more powerful (and easier to write) than basic regular expressions. Fixed
strings might come in handy once in a while, for example when searching for
strings containing meta characters such as <code>^</code> (beginning of a line) and <code>$</code>
(end of a line).</p>
<pre><code>$ cat &gt; script.sh
sed 's/^hello$/hi/g'
$ grep -F '^hello$' script.sh
sed 's/^hello$/hi/g'
</code></pre>
<p>If I’d use basic or extended regular expressions here, the caret and the
dollar sign needed to be escaped in order to match the same line:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -G '\^hello\$' script.sh
sed 's/^hello$/hi/g'
</code></pre>
<p>Not escaping the caret and the dollar sign would not match any line, because
it would be interpreted as a line beginning or ending, respectively.</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -G $foo script.sh
</code></pre>
<p><code>grep -G</code> might come in handier than <code>grep -E</code> for the same reason: when
searching for literal characters braces, for example, which needed to be
escaped using extended regular expressions.</p>

<h4>Wednesday, November 30<sup>th</sup> 2016</h4>

<h2 id="003">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#003">003</a>: This Page</h2>
<p>This page is static HTML generated by a shell script called <code>generate.sh</code>.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

    echo '&lt;/article&gt;' &gt;&gt; $PAGE
done
cat footer.html &gt;&gt; $PAGE
</code></pre>
<p>First, a static header file (<code>header.html</code>) is written into <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<p>Then the script iterates over all articles, which I write in <code>markdown</code>
files named from <code>001.md</code> to <code>999.md</code> (I might have to do some refactoring
during the next three years…). It does so in reverse order, so that the
newest entry is always on top. Every markdown file is first processed by a
<code>sed</code> script <code>smart_quotes.sed</code>. It replaces straight quotes with nicer quote
characters, two hyphens with a dash and three full stops with an ellipsis.</p>
<p>Every article is converted to HTML using <code>markdown</code> and included into the
<code>index.html</code> file inside an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag. Empty lines are removed with
<code>sed</code>.</p>
<p>At the end, the content from <code>footer.html</code> is included into <code>index.html</code>. And
after the page has been generated, I put it online using <code>git</code>.</p>

at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Literature: <em>Walden</em>, by Henry David Thoreau</li>
<li>Programming: Regular Expressions</li>
<li>Russian: verb conjugations</li>
</ul>
<p>Until I’m going to start on those, there’s still an entire month. But I can’t
just sit and wait and see how my motivation will be faded away by then by doing
nothing. So I’m going to do a little one-month prelude, doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Literature: read <em>Homo Faber</em> by Max Frisch</li>
<li>Programming: get to know the <code>grep</code>-command and its options</li>
<li>Russian: learn the infinitive aspect pairs of the most common 50 Russian
verbs</li>
</ul>
<p>If I don’t manage to do that, I also won’t manage to do the “real thing”
next year. So I have to get through with it. Let’s get started…</p>

<h2 id="001">
<a href="https://patrickbucher.github.io/starting-over/#001">001</a>: Starting Over</h2>
<p>I’m 29 and totally stuck. I don’t get ahead with the things I care about and
have tried to put some effort in during the last couple of years. Those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Literature</li>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>Russian</li>
</ul>
<p>This year, I quit my job and started studying computer science. I’m supposed
to learn a lot about programming (and computers in general) during the next
couple of years. But that won’t be enough, or at least I won’t learn that
much about the subjects I’m really interested in. I didn’t learn a lot at
university during the first term. And I didn’t have time to improve in the
areas I really care about—or just squandered it mindlessly on YouTube.</p>
<p>Now I have to change a couple of things.</p>
<p>If I’d just focus on one thing per area at a time, and assign half a year to
every thing, I might actually make some progress again. Those will be little
baby steps, but at least the knowledge can sink in slowly, evenly and deeply.</p>
<p>What are those <em>things</em>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Literature: <em>The Iliad</em>, <em>The Odyssey</em>, <em>Anna Karenina</em>, <em>Brothers
Karamazov</em>, <em>The Idiot</em>, <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>, <em>Walden</em>, etc.</li>
<li>Programming: Regular Expressions, <code>bash</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, C, <code>git</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Russian: numerals, verbal aspects, verbs of motion, verb conjugations,
faster touch typing, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens if I’d just pick one for, say, January to June 2017? Could I
possibly stick to it?</p>
<p>If I actually could, then I finally would make some progress again.</p>
